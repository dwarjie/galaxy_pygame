# galaxy_pygame

A simple galaxy game base on tutorial of RealPython about PyGame.

I added some functionalities:
  - Coins/Score collecting
  - Game Over Screen

All sound effects are randomly made in Bfxr: https://www.bfxr.net/
All sprites are made by Kenney: https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-extension
And background music is from RealPython github.

This is my first game in pygame so hope you enjoy it.
